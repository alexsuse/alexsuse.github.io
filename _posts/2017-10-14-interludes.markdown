Through a series of events I'd rather not go into deeply, I've recently had the
chance to revisit the music of Manu Chao. I was always fascinated at how many
songs they were able to recreate with the exact same feeling. I'm suprised at
how many different songs my memory insisted into mapping to only one. I actually
listened to most of "Clandestino" sure that "Me Gustas Tu" was the next song coming
up. Turned out that album just happened to have another five songs that recreated
the same ambience. Some of them seem like mere interludes. "Je ne t'aime plus"
sure sounds like one verse of the lyrics stretched out. Yet, at the same time
they all sound so intimately crafted and recorded.

Anyhow, then I had dinner and sat down to listen to some more music. Started out
with Kendrick Lamar. Honestly, "To Pimp a Butterfly" is an artistic achievement
I put in the same level of "OK Computer" and Sgt. Pepper's. The middle section,
driving from "If these walls could talk" to "Alright" is just crazy. The song
joining them together "u" is very peculiar. It is two confessional songs glued
together. It's almost as an interlude to the main songs, but it always struck
me the hardest. The first one angry and confrontational, the second one
disappointed and revengeful, both full of the same incontent aggressivity that
Kendrick Lamar can express like no one. But at the same time, they never rise
up to a proper chorus, or a conclusion in any way. Yet, they do that so
greatly (the song is on the video only until about 3:50, then it's another
song).

Well, after some more thinking, I realized I have a thing for interludes. I've
recently got tickets to Neon Indian and while most of his "Psychic Chasms" is
burned into my brain, the track that I go back to the most is a 47 second
filler from that album. "(If I Knew, I'd tell you)" is the perfect trippy,
synthy, retro filler. It just hints at some amazing verse that mounted up to it
and to a great closer coming right after it, but does not actually show them.

Another killer interlude that I've obsessed over for a long time is Frank Ocean's
"Fertilizer". It's a perfectly valid hook for a 6-minute Stevie Wonder song, but
he just hid it as a single chorus stuck in the middle of his "Channel Orange"
album. The song is perfectly dwarved by everything else on the album, but it
gives us a perfect glimpse of something that could be there if Frank Ocean 
wanted us to listen to it. (It turns out this is actually a full song that
he recorded with another artist, I'm still impressed by how that short
bit of it that's in the album sets an amazing mood).

To close off this rambling post, there's another interlude I enjoy a lot.
"Nangs" by Tame Impala. It's definitely not Tame Impala, but somehow it fits
perfectly in their weird trippy album. The whole song is basically one verse
throbbing around the trippy drums and drawn-out synths. It could definitely
go much further, but they didn't want to go there.

Maybe that's the thing I enjoy about interludes. They hint at something that
could be, but they don't define it. They give you a taste of something that's
not quite there, but only a taste. I'll finish with one more Tame Impala song
that's nearly an interlude as well. It has a chorus and whatnot, but at 1:48,
it barely counts as a full song. "Disciples" from the same record also bridges
two perfectly amazing song and never quite goes all the way to where you'd
expect it to.
